::: {#hero-heading}

I am a Data Scientist with a background in mathematics and senior experience in auditing at a Big Four accounting firm.

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist in the logistics industry. I primarily build interactive R [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) dashboards with real-time geospatial visualizations, develop automated reporting pipelines using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and apply machine learning and computer vision models to detect risky driving behaviors.

**Also, I am available for freelance jobs related to R Shiny, data science and machine learning.**

For a more detailed view of my work experience, you can take a look at my [English CV](../resources/cv/leonardo-kamogawa-cv-data-scientist.pdf) or my [Portuguese CV](../resources/cv/leonardo-kamogawa-cv-cientista-de-dados.pdf).

If you have any questions or want to hire my services, [mail me!](mailto:leonardo.kamogawa@hotmail.com) I will be glad to help.

## About me

After telling you what I do, maybe you want to know who I am!

If so, check my **digital garden**: [{{< var digital-garden.name >}}]({{< var digital-garden.url >}}). There you will find my notes and thoughts about almost everything and read about *The Life and Opinions of Leonardo Kamogawa, Gentleman*.

## About this website

This website has two opposite purposes: to showcase my professional abilities (selfish) and to share useful knowledge to everyone (altruistic). 

Despite the antithesis, I think that these two are good reasons to start a professional blog.
