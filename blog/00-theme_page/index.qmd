# About this site

This page is used to preview how changes in `.yml`, `.css` and `.scss` files affect my blog posts.

This page is meant to be accessed only when you are rendering this [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org) website locally. If you are accessing this page on my [live website](https://www.lkamogawa.com/custom), you can report it as an *issue* in [this link]({{< var github >}}/lkamogawa_quarto/issues)[^1].

## Code

### Inline

`R Code below`

### Block

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

data <-
  penguins |>                                    # <1>
  mutate(                                        # <2>
    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm, # <2>
    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm  # <2>
  )                                              # <2>

which_penguin <- function(data, penguin) {
  data |> filter(species == penguin)
}

which_penguin(data, "Adelie")
```

1. Take `penguins`, and then,
2. add new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.
